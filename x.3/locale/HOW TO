forum.Pinguino.cc in Suggestions for Improvement section.

This document includes general information about how to install this translation

	(da) Detush
	(en) English

This is a initial selection, based on the list of countries of Pinguino users
and activist around the world, refered by J.P.Mandon at HackingLab's Blog.

Of course, more language support can be easily incorporated, edited by others

Each directory language, are indentified with two-letter codes of ISO-639-1
internationalization standard.

The ".mo" files (MACHINE Objects) are BINARY files, than contains the
no-traduced/traduced pairs. These are used by the pygettext code included into
the new pinguino.py file, to traduce the application at run time.

The ".po" files (PORTABLE Objects) are TEXT files, than also contains the
no-traduced/traduced pairs. These are used by developers, to edit all words
needed to traduce the application, before compilate them to ".mo" files.

4.- Instructions to Modify or Update the traduction files
===============================================================================
a) Download/Install "poedit" (Easy to use GUI tool to edit po/mo files).
b) Execute translate.py
c) Select language
d) Edit the the Poedit SearchPath.
e) Edit the traduced values, and save. poedit will re-generate .mo file 
		If a particular original string does not need to be translated, 
		then leave the translation value blank.
f) Execute your pinguino IDE !! you can see your changes

Please, don't forget to send us your modified files (.po/.mo) to include them 
in the new versions of PinguinoIDE, you can send it to the mailing list 
https://groups.google.com/group/pinguinocard, you can hang it on the 
forum specific to your language http://forum.pinguino.cc/forumdisplay.php?fid=23
